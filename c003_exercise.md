### Discussion

5. What do you think will happen if you use a negative number as the second
parameter in the round function? For example, what should be the result
of round (314.159265, -1) ? Explain the rationale for your answer. After
you've written your answer, consult the Python documentation or try out
some examples to see what Python actually does in this case.


    It seems that Python that the argument -1, tells python to round a number
    to the nearest tens place.

**17. You have seen that the math library contains a function that computes
the square root of numbers. In this exercise, you are to write your own
algorithm for computing square roots. One way to solve this problem
is to use a guess-and -check approach. You first guess what the square
root might be, and then see how close your guess is. You can use this
information to make another guess and continue guessing until you have
found the square root (or a close approximation to it). One particularly
good way of making guesses is to use Newton's method. Suppose x is the
number we want the root of, and guess is the current guessed answer. The
guess can be improved by using computing the next guess as:**

	[(guess)+(x/guess)]/2

**Write a program that implements Newton's method. The program
should prompt the user for the value to find the square root of (x) and
the number of times to improve the guess. Starting with a guess value
of x/2, your program should loop the specified number of times applying
Newton's method and report the final value of guess. You should also
subtract your estimate from the value of math.sqrt (x) to show how close
it is.**
