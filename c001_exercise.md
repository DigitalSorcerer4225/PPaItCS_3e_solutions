		- A computer does only two things: compute and store information.
		-   CPU - The “brain” of a computer. Can only access information located in the main memory. During a program is run, the CPU does what is called the fetch-decode-execute cycle. Basically, it fetches the sequence of instructions from the memory, decodes what it means, then executes those sequences of instructions.
		-   Main Memory - Information storage that can send and receive data from the CPU. Also, it is information transfer speed is very fast! When no power is received, information inside it are lost.
		-   Secondary Memory - As called long term memory storage. Used for storing information that is not currently accessed by the CPU. Has many kinds: SSD, HDD, DVD, Flash drive, etc. Can store information even when there is no power.
		-   Input devices - used to input information to the computer.
		-   Output devices - used to display information.

### Programming Exercises
  
3. 
-   $x$ seems to approach $0.5$ as the line `x = 2.0 * x * (1 - x)` is repeatedly run. It appears that the ‘randomness’ has vanished.

5. 
  
```python
# File: chaos.py
# A simple program illustrating chaotic behavior.

def main():
    n = eval(input("How many numbers should I print?"))
    print("This program illustrates a chaotic function")
    x = eval(input("Enter a number between 0 and 1: "))
    for i in range(n):
        x = 3.9 * x * (1 - x)
        print(x)

main()
```

6. 

```python
# File: chaos.py
# A simple program illustrating chaotic behavior.

def main():
 #   n = eval(input("How many numbers should I print?"))
    print("This program illustrates a chaotic function")
    x = eval(input("Enter a number between 0 and 1: "))
    y = x
    z = x
    for i in range(100):
        x = 3.9 * x * (1 - x)
        y = 3.9 * (y - y * y)
        z = 3.9 * z - 3.9 * z * z
        print(x, y, z)
        print('\n')

main()
```
7. (not my answer)

```python
# File: chaos.py
# Chaos program to print side-by-side values
# Note: This output is UGLY, but uses only things seen in Chapter 1
#       For a more elegant version see c05ex12.py

def main():
    print("This program illustrates a chaotic function")
    x1 = eval(input("Enter the first seed between 0 and 1: "))
    x2 = eval(input("Enter the second seed between 0 and 1: "))
    print()
    print("input     ", x1, " | ", x2)
    print("-------------------------------------------")
    for i in range(10):
        x1 = 3.9 * x1 * (1 - x1)
        x2 = 3.9 * x2 * (1 - x2)
        print("      ", x1, " | ", x2)

main()
```
